A dataset dealing with data analytics job positions held in the United States. This is something that I feel is extremely relevant to everyone taking this class. It goes over items such as salary, location, and company rating for individual job listings in data analytics around the nation. After reviewing this dataset, it would be interesting to find out which areas or companies of the United States tend to offer the highest paying salaries for this type of position. In addition, what job listing or listings in particular have certain traits in common between those attributes that are listed.
